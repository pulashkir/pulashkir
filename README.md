### 🧱 About Me

I'm a software builder — the kind who cares less about trends and more about results.

I focus on **shipping stable, scalable, maintainable** solutions.  
Whether it's an internal tool, a robust API, or an automation pipeline, I believe in clean architecture and deep work.

I thrive when there's structure, purpose, and something real to deliver.
